Temperature â€“ Thermal Statistics

The output from this Shiny app is derived from the StreamThermal R package on GitHub (https://github.com/tsangyp/StreamThermal). 
It generates over 200 different thermal metrics that cover five categories of stream thermal regimes: magnitude, variability, frequency, timing, and rate of change.
