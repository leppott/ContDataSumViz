Temperature – Thermal classification

COMING LATER ...

When resources permit, we will add in functions that assign sites to thermal classes based on the national classification schemes in Maheu et al. (2015) and McManamay & DeRolph (2018). 

The Maheu et al. (2015) scheme has six annual thermal regime classes: stable cold, stable cool, variable cold, variable cool, highly variable cool and variable warm. 
McManamay & DeRolph (2018) used two schemes: one based on Maheu et al. (2015) and the other based on the following ranges of mean July-August stream temperature:
  Very cold <10°C
  Cold 10-15°C
  Cold-cool 15-18°C
  Cool 18-21°C
  Cool-warm 21-24°C
  Warm >24°C
