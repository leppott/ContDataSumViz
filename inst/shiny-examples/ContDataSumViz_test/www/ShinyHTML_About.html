<p>The ContDataSumViz Shiny app is a free R-based tool to help visualize continuous data (that has been QCed) in a standardized way without having to download any software programs to your computer. This Shiny app is linked to the ContDataQC R package, which was developed by Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech and is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC</a>). The table below provides an overview of how the website is structured.</p>
<p>Development of the ContDataSumViz R tools has been funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for freshwater streams and inland lakes (USEPA 2016, USEPA 2021; lead EPA scientist: Britta Bierwagen). The RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect long-term data at targeted sites to detect changes over time.</p>
<p>If you encounter problems with the Shiny app and/or have suggestions on ways to further improve it, please email Erik (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) or post your comments on the ContDataSumViz GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataSumViz/discussions" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/ContDataSumViz/discussions</a>). This is an open-source, collaborative effort and we welcome your feedback.</p>
